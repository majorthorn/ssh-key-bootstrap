## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, open a GitHub issue using the `security` label. Expect a confirmation within 2 business days, follow-up about the fix status within one week, and an indication whether the issue will be remediated or declined.

When submitting a report:

- Include a clear description of the issue and the impact.
- Share reproduction steps, payloads, and logs if available.
- Highlight versions/flags/hosts involved.
- Do not publicly disclose the issue until it has been addressed or you have permission.

We aim to release fixes via GitHub (tagged branches) and notify the reporter once a patch or mitigation is merged. If you can contribute a fix, please submit a pull request referencing the issue so we can review and land it safely.
